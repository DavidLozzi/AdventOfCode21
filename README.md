# Advent Of Code 2021

Follow along for my adventures in this year's Advent of Code! Go to [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) and join in on the fun! I'm excited to be doing this again this year, [last year was a blast](https://davidlozzi.com/tag/advent-of-code/) ([the code repo is here](https://github.com/DavidLozzi/adventcode2020))! 

## What I'll be doing

I'll be aiming to achieve all of the challenges before year end, like I did last year. I'll do my best to keep on top of it daily, but with work, life, Christmas, etc. things can get busy. So before 2022 I'll get it all done!

I won't be blogging every challenge like I did last year. That ended up being a lot of work, easily doubleing the time/effort for some challenges. I'll rely on the code here, I'll comment my code well and ensure it's helpful. I'll also keep this Readme up to date as I go. Click the Watch button at the top right to get notifications! Or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/davidlozzi) as I'll share there as well.

### The tech stack

Last year I built everything in vanilla JavaScript and NodeJS. This year, I'll be kicking off in ReactJS. I'm curious to see what can be done in the framework, along with what fun can I have on the UI side. We'll see, I'm no designer.
